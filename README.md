# [Model-View Architectures](README.md)

Understanding structures, purposes and advantages of Model-View architectures may be challenging.

This repository aims to provide some examples to facilitate this understanding and make the differences between some 
Model-View architectures:
* **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**
* **Model-View-Presenter (MVP)**
* **and Model-View-View-Model (MVVM)**

Before to navigate between them, it may be useful to remind the advantages of a **Model**, and those of a **View**.

That's why the firsts folders will explore simple Task Manager applications in different contexts and the next ones 
their uses in some Model-View patterns :

1. [Without Model or View](1_No_Model/No_Model.md) (as 2 separate programs)
2. [With a Model](2_Model/Model.md) (a shared data mechanism in 2 separate programs)
3. [With a Model and Views](3_Model_View/Model_View.md) (a shared data mechanism but in a single program)


4. [With Model-View-Controller (MVC)]
5. [With Model-View-Presenter (MVP)]
6. [With Model-View-View-Model (MVVM)]
